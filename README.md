🚀 Project: "GitHub" - Real-Time Event Pipeline
Date: November 2025

🎯 Objective
This project implements an end-to-end streaming data pipeline that captures, processes, and stores public events from the GitHub API in real-time. The objective is to demonstrate a robust, scalable, and fault-tolerant architecture built with industry-standard open-source tools, orchestrated with Docker.

Data is processed and stored in a Data Lake in Parquet format, ready for analysis.

🏛️ Solution Architecture
This architecture uses a decoupled streaming flow where Kafka acts as a central "buffer" (or queue) to ensure fault tolerance. All services are orchestrated via Docker Compose for easy execution and portability. The data flows in real-time from the source (GitHub API) to the aggregated Data Lake, ready for analysis.

The flow works in 6 steps:

Orchestration (Airflow): An Apache Airflow DAG is scheduled to run every 5 minutes.

Production (Python): The DAG executes a script (producer.py) that calls the GitHub API and sends the events (JSONs) to Kafka.

Messaging (Kafka): Kafka ingests and stores the messages in the github_events_raw topic. If the consumer (Spark) fails, Kafka retains the data, ensuring zero data loss.

Consumption (Spark): A Spark Structured Streaming job (consumer.py) listens to the Kafka topic 24/7.

Transformation (ETL): As data arrives, Spark processes it in micro-batches:

It defines and applies a schema to the data.

It "flattens" the nested JSON structures (e.g., actor.login, repo.name).

It creates partitioning columns (year, month, day).

Loading (DataLake): The clean, transformed data is saved in Parquet format to a local volume, partitioned by date.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Docker & Docker Compose

Role: Virtualization & Environment.

Why: Containerizes every service, ensuring a portable and reproducible environment.

Apache Airflow

Role: Task Orchestration.

Why: Reliably schedules the producer script at regular intervals.

Apache Kafka

Role: Message Bus (Buffer).

Why: The heart of fault tolerance. It decouples the producer from the consumer, guaranteeing zero data loss if the consumer fails.

Apache Spark

Role: Streaming Data Processing.

Why: A powerful, distributed engine for large-scale ETL. Structured Streaming allows for efficient real-time (micro-batch) processing.

Python

Role: The "glue" of the project.

Why: Used to write the Producer (producer.py) and Consumer (consumer.py via PySpark) scripts.

Parquet Format

Role: Optimized Storage (Data Lake).

Why: A highly compressed, columnar format ideal for fast analytical queries.


▶️ How to Run This Project
Follow these steps to configure and run the entire pipeline on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
Docker Desktop (for Windows/Mac).

A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with public_repo permissions.

2. Environment Setup (Windows Only)
This project was debugged to solve specific Windows-Docker issues:

Expose the Docker Daemon:

Open Docker Desktop Settings > General.

CHECK the box: "Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS".

Click "Apply & Restart".

Verify the Airflow DAG:

The airflow/dags/github_events_dag.py file must use docker_url='tcp://host.docker.internal:2375' in the DockerOperator.

3. Project Setup
First, clone the repository and create the .env file for Airflow permissions.


git clone https://github.com/jovesoncosta/streaming-data-pipeline-kafka-spark-airflow.git
cd your-repository
echo "AIRFLOW_UID=50000" > .env
(The GITHUB_TOKEN will be configured in the Airflow UI for better security.)

Next, build the Docker image that Airflow will use to run the producer:


docker build -t github_producer:latest ./producer
4. Starting the Pipeline (Command Sequence)
1. Start All Services:


docker-compose up -d
2. Configure the Airflow Variable:

Wait 1-2 minutes for Airflow to start.

Access the UI: http://localhost:8081 (login: admin / pass: admin).

Go to "Admin" -> "Variables".

Add a new variable:

Key: GITHUB_TOKEN

Val: Paste your GitHub Token (e.g., ghp_...).

Click "Save".

3. Create the Kafka Topic: (The topic must be created manually, as docker-compose down deletes it.)


docker-compose exec kafka kafka-topics --create --topic github_events_raw --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
4. Start the Consumer (Spark):

Open a new terminal (and keep it open).

Run the Spark job. It will "listen" to the Kafka topic.


docker-compose exec --user root spark-master /opt/spark/bin/spark-submit --master spark://spark-master:7077 --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.5.1 /opt/spark/work-dir/app/consumer.py
5. Start the Producer (Airflow):

With Spark "listening," go back to the Airflow UI.

Enable the github_events_producer DAG (click the "play" toggle).

Trigger it manually by clicking the "play" button > "Trigger DAG".

5. Verify the Results
Spark Terminal: You will see the micro-batches being printed to the terminal (from the format("console") sink).

Data Lake: Check the spark/data/processed/events/ folder. The year, month, and day folders will be created and will contain your .parquet files!
